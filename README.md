# Sandbox
Augmented Reality with Kinect

This is a an IT Project of stundents from UAS Technikum Wien

As of now two students are working on this project: Lorenz and Josh

The Goal is to creat a program that gets Data from a Kinect pointed at a sanbox and translates the different heights to different colors.
A Beamer will be projecting these colors onto the Sand, so that we create a dynamic and interactive laandscape.

In future semesters we want to implement differen handgestures to further alter the colors and what happens in the sandbox.
ultimatively it is planned that we can place units in the sandbox and creat a strategy game. But this will be a project of it's own.

cheers
Lorenz and Josh

PS: this is also our first project where we are using github.
